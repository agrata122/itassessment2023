            <h1 align="center">What is Web Design?</h1>
Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually 
refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software 
development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop 
browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has 
become ever-increasingly important.
